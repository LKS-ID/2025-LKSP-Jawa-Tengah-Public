Creativity: Requires the number to be larger than 100000, this can be observied by trying to input a small number vs a large number, the larger the number, the bigger the grade until it reaches the maximum of 5

Balance: Requires the amount of unique digits in the number to be exactly 5 numbers, for example 12345, 123454321, 7788123, etc. 

Harmony: Requires the number to be a perfect square, for example 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc.

The key is to analyze each components separately, and then combining them at the end once the pattern is known

Smallest number you can come up with is 100489
