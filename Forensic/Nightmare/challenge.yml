  Yesterday was a disaster to one of the well-known AI company. They suffered a massive breach due to a malware infection in the internal server. It was believed that the attack vector comes from one of the employee's work due to a malicious Torch model as a initial vector of a shellcode-dropper.

  The malware author's domain is seized already but we need to know where does the malware is downloaded and its location on disk. Can you help us?

  Flag = `LKS{name of the malware from domain without extension combined with malware filename on the disk without extension}`

  Example: You checked that the malware's filename from real domain is haha.bin and it was saved in your computer as jaja.exe, then the flag is `LKS{hahajaja}`
